## Updating the README

When asked to **update the readme** (or "update the README", "refresh the readme", "rebuild the index", etc.):

1. **Index the repository**  
   List all non-git files and directories under the repo root. Do not include `.git` or its contents.

2. **Reflect the directory structure**  
   The README must show the actual folder hierarchy and list the files in each directory. Use a clear, consistent format (e.g. tree-style or nested bullets).

3. **Link to files**  
   For each listed file, provide a working relative link so readers can jump to the file from the README (e.g. `[SimplexTableau.mlx](Operational%20Research/Linear%20Programming/SimplexTableau.mlx)`).

4. **Keep it accurate**  
   Base the index on the current state of the repo (e.g. by listing or scanning the filesystem). Do not invent or omit files.

5. **Preserve other README content**  
   If the README already has a project description, usage notes, or other sections, keep them and only update or replace the index section as needed.

Summary: **When updating the readme, you must properly index what exists in the directories and link to the files.**
